# Project Proposal

# Objective
The goal is to promote connections among non-profit and non-governmental organizations and help them find sponsors. The project consists of three parts: information extraction, content mining, and search engine. 


# Method One: Information Extraction
**Algorithm Search**</br>
Automatically searched for all web pages in recent 6 months that included ALL NGO organization names. Note that this search system was complicated and required a good deal of  time to run for all organizations. </br>
**Activeness Assessment**</br>
When more than one webpage was found, the algorithm extracted information from the official website, Facebook and INS. If relevant webpage is not found, the listings returned a ‘suspect’ warning. </br>
**Limitations**</br>
Note that the automatic extractor is hosted by google search. Non-English websites cannot be assessed for activeness. Also, organizations that didn’t post any events online ould also not be identified. Manual efforts required.</br>
