## Project Proposal

## Objective
The goal is to promote connections among non-profit and non-governmental organizations and help them find sponsors. The project consists of three parts: information extraction, content mining, and search engine. 

## Information Extraction
# Algorithm Search
Automatically searched for all web pages in recent 6 months that included ALL NGO organization names. Note that this search system was complicated and required a good deal of  time to run for all organizations.
